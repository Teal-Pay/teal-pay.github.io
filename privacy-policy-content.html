              such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other

              (described in the "Third-Party Analytics Services" section), which
              use automated technologies to help us evaluate how customers use

              These third party ad services track your online activities over

            <h2>How Long We Keep Your Information</h2>
            <p>
              We keep your information as long as you keep using our products
              and services. After that, we keep it for as long as we need it to
              do things like fight fraud, collect fees you owe, resolve disputes
              with (or involving) you, follow the law, enforce our agreements
              and defend our rights in court.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We generally keep your information as long as reasonably necessary
              to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable law.
              However, even after you deactivate your account, we can retain
              copies of information about you and any transactions or Services
              in which you may have participated for a period of time that is
              consistent with applicable law, applicable statute of limitations
              or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable
              law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to detect
              or prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve disputes, to
              address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations,
              to enforce our General Terms or other applicable agreements or
              policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable
              law.

              Location Information In order to provide certain Services, we may
              request access to location information, including precise
              geolocation information collected from your device. If you do not
              consent to the collection of this information, certain Services
              will not function properly and you will not be able to use those
              Services. You can stop our collection of location information at
              any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you
              do so, some of our mobile applications will no longer function.
              You also may stop our collection of location information via
              mobile application by following the standard uninstall process to
              remove all Gemm mobile applications from your device.

              Promotional Communicationa You can opt out of receiving
              promotional messages from Gemm by following the instructions in
              those messages, by informing the caller that you would not like to
              receive future promotional calls, or by changing your notification
              settings by logging into your Gemm account. You may only opt out
              of text messages from Gemm by replying STOP. Opting out of
              receiving communications may impact your use of the Services. If
              you decide to opt out, we may still send you non-promotional
              communications, such as digital receipts and messages about your
              account or our ongoing business relations.
