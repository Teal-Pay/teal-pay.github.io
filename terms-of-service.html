              We treat all activities under a Gemm Account to be those of the
              registered user. You must only use the Services to transact on
              your own account. You may only open one Gemm Account unless we
              explicitly approve the opening of additional accounts. We may
              refuse the creation of duplicate accounts for the same user. Where
              duplicate accounts are detected, Gemm may close or merge these
              duplicate accounts without notification to you.
            </p>

              Gemm’s services are currently available only to customers
              operating within the United States. By using Gemm, you confirm

            </p>

            <p>
              For compliance and safety, certain locations are not eligible to
              use Gemm as senders. This includes residents of Cuba, Iran, North
              Korea, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions. Other
              jurisdictions may be restricted or require additional review
              before access is granted. These measures help us meet regulatory
              obligations and maintain a secure platform for all users.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are also unable to work with individuals or entities that

              United States, United Kingdom, European Union, or United Nations.
              This includes, but is not limited to, the U.S. Office of Foreign

              You, not Gemm, are responsible for maintaining adequate security
              and control of any and all IDs, passwords, or any other details
              that you use to access your Gemm Account and the Services. You
              must never disclose your Gemm Account password or your customer
              reference number. Gemm and its employees, associates, partners and
              vendors will never request your Gemm Account password. Keep them
              safe. Change your password regularly. Tell us if anyone asks for
              your password, and contact us if you are not sure about this, or
              any other security-related aspect of your Gemm Account. 
            </p>

            <p>
              You must never let anyone access your Gemm Account or watch you

            <p>
              If you suspect your Gemm Account, login details, password or any

              authorization or otherwise compromised, you are advised to change
              your password. Contact us immediately if you believe your
              credentials have been compromised or you are suspicious about the
              security of your password or any other security features. The
              compromise of your credentials could enable thieves to access your
              account and attempt transactions not authorized by you.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, contact us at once if your transaction history for
              your Gemm Account shows transactions that you did not initiate. We
              rely on you to regularly check the transaction history of your
              Gemm Account and to contact us immediately in case you have any
              questions or concerns. We may (but are not obligated to) suspend
              your Gemm Account or otherwise restrict its functionality if we
              have concerns about the security of the Gemm Account or any of its
              security features; or potential unauthorized or fraudulent use of

            <h2>Initiating a Transfer</h2>

            <p>
              All transfer requests must be made via our API following the
              established protocols and guidelines. Gemm will establish a cut
              off time during each business day where transfer requests will be
              processed in accordance to the date and time the instructions were
              received and confirmed. All Source Currency must be made in USD
              unless otherwise agreed. You will be able to see the Target
              Currency, the exchange rate, applicable fees, and approximate
              processing time in your Gemm Account.
            </p>

            <p>
              Upon submitting your Transfer request, you will have 2 business
              days (unless otherwise agreed) to confirm the list of transactions
              and wire the funds to Gemm for us to initiate the transfer
              request. Any delay and/or discrepancies in the wired amount
              received by Gemm will result in a delay in initiating the
              transfer. If wired funds are received after the agreed business
              days, payments to beneficiaries will be delayed. Gemm reserves the
              right to use the latest FX rate to complete the Transfer request.
              Any additional amount discrepancies due to the changes in FX rate
              as a result of your or your bank's wire transfer delay will be
              borne by you. Gemm will work with you for the recovery of the
              additional funds owed to Gemm.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will work with Gemm to resolve any discrepancies without
              delays. Gemm has the right to reject, decline, or cancel in part
              or in full any Transfer request at its discretion. Once a transfer
              is initiated by Gemm, we will not be able to make any changes to
              the transactions, including changing the amount, delaying,
              canceling the transaction, changing the recipient or the Target
              Currency.

              arise between you and Gemm, and regardless of your location.
              Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all
              disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect
              of the relationship between you and Gemm, whether based in
              contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other
              legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding
              arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a
              judge or jury and you agree that Gemm and you are each waiving the
              right to trial by a jury. You agree that any arbitration under
              this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class

              The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or

              arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an
              in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will
              be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both
              parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and
              other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree
              on a location, such determination should be made by the
              arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision will follow the terms of
              this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will
              have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive
              relief or relief providing for specific performance of this
              Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief
              warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award
              rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any
              court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the
              foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from
              bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local
              agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us
              for you.
